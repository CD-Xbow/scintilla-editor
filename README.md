This is a simple editor based on Scintilla.that does the basic stuff, it even opens files!!!!
I say that because 95% of Scintilla examples don't and they don't because it is a pig to do..
The code is straight forward and resonably well commented. Evertthing works, though a couple 
of things are klutzy, like the printing. The repo contains all the files needed and a compiled
version for Windows.
